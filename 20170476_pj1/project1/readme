student.h file:

 1. Student class
    # public
    get_name(): get private variable _name
    get_id(): get private variable _stunum
    get_lab(): virtual function
               if object is Grad_Student, return _lab_name
               if object is Undergrad_Student, return empty string
               Since, empty input from user is not allowed.
    get_fresh(): virtual function
               if object is Grad_Student, return integer -1
               if object is Undergrad_Student, return _freshmen_class
               Since, negative integer input from user is not allowed.
    friend class Grad_Student and Undergrad_Student to access private variables in print_all()
 

2. Manager class
   # public
   1. Student double pointer that points to array of Student class pointers.
   2. Variable count that counts the total number of students registered.
   3. Manager constructor makes student class pointer array size of 300.
   4. Manager destructor that when main function return, the remaining dynamically allocated
      memory can be delete so that no memory leak occurs

student.cpp file:

   1. string headerfile, use loads of fuctions to handling string
   2. limits headerfile to handling input from users
   3. cctype headerfile to use isspace, isalpha, isdigit

 compare_student function
   : First, dynamically allocate the object that has argument information
     compare two object, one in stu array, another in newly created object.
     Using == operator (overloaded), compare two object

main.cpp file:

   input format: one by one
   Name -> Student ID -> Lab Name / Class
   There should be always input, no input is not allowed.
   First input, should be only 1 character.
   Second input, whether 0 or 1, only allow two integer 0 and 1.
   Name input = only string that contains alphabets and spaces
   Student ID input = only integer that no spaces allowed
   Lab name input = only string that contains alphabets and spaces.
   Freshmen class input = only integer that no spaces allowed.
   Index input = only integer that no spaces allowed.
