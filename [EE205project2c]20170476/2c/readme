## Project 2c - iterator implementation ##

The data structure used in this program is doubly linked-list with exactly
same algorithm making packet.

There are 4 types of iterator operators, pre-increment ++/--, !=, ==, *(reference)

First, pre-increment ++/--
Change the Iter class memeber variable "node" to next(or prev) node pointer
then return this pointer which points to itself.

Second, !=/==
Compare the Iter class member variable "node" with one another.
if same, return true. Otherwise return false.

Lastly, reference *
Get the data1 variable of that node. Since this program only need the first Message
number, just get data1 variable is enough.

I specified the
value_type, reference, pointer, difference_type, iterator_category.
Also as i mentioned, this program only need first int varaible in node.
So, iterator with only work with int varaiable is enough in this program.
